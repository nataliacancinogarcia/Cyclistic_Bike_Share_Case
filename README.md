 [The Cyclistic Bike-Share Marketing Project](https://github.com/nataliacancinogarcia/Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Case/blob/main/cyclistic-bike-share-analysis-in-r.ipynb)  aims to analyze bike usage patterns between casual riders 🚲 and annual members  to develop targeted marketing strategies . The primary goal is to encourage casual riders to convert into more profitable annual memberships  by leveraging Cyclistic’s historical bike trip data .
