🚴‍♀️ The Cyclistic Bike-Share Marketing Project 🚴‍♂️ aims to analyze bike usage patterns between casual riders 🚲 and annual members 📅 to develop targeted marketing strategies 🎯. The primary goal is to encourage casual riders to convert into more profitable annual memberships 💳 by leveraging Cyclistic’s historical bike trip data 📊.

The analysis was conducted using R programming language 💻, and a Tableau [dashboard](https://github.com/nataliacancinogarcia/Cyclistic_Bike_Share_Case/blob/main/Dashboard%201%20(3).png) 📊 has been created for an interactive exploration of the data.
